# Medium Member-Only Post Remover

Discover a more inclusive and fair Medium experience, where free content shines.

## The Challenge with Medium

Medium is a treasure trove of knowledge and insights, offering stories that inform, inspire, and provoke thought. However, the platform's increasing emphasis on promoting "Member-only" paid articles poses a challenge. This approach not only prioritizes paid content over freely available articles but also inadvertently marginalizes the financially disadvantaged readers, and those simply seeking open access to information. The result? A diminished visibility for free posts, creating an unfair landscape for both readers and writers of free content.

## Our Solution

The Medium Member-Only Post Remover extension aims to democratize your reading experience. By seamlessly removing "Member-only" articles from your feed, this tool ensures that free, accessible content gets the spotlight it deserves. It's our small step towards a more inclusive, fair, and balanced Medium ecosystem.

## How It Works
